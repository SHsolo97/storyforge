    "prompt": "A cinematic, hyper-detailed, slightly unsettling upper-body character portrait of Harold, the giant. He is an enormous man, over fifteen feet tall, with a sad, downtrodden expression. He is dressed in simple, oversized rags and is hunched over in a prison cell that is far too small for him. The scene is illuminated by faint, gloomy light, creating a pathetic and somber atmosphere. The overall style emphasizes his immense scale and sorrow."
