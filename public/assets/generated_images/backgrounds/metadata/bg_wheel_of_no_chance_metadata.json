    "prompt": "A cinematic, hyper-detailed, slightly unsettling close-up of a carnival game booth. A large, garish spinning wheel is the centerpiece, with a sign above it reading 'Wheel of No Chance'. The booth is empty except for a single, unnervingly intelligent-looking parrot on a perch. The style is 90s spooky, with faded paint and a layer of grime on everything."
