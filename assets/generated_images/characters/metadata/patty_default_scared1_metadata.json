She is the bossy friend, with fiery red hair and a face full of freckles. Her eyes are wide with fear, and her hands might be raised defensively. She is wearing a simple 90s-style t-shirt. The scene is illuminated by a single, harsh light from below, casting spooky shadows. The overall style emphasizes detailed textures and a slightly distorted, wide-angle perspective."

Use consistent color palette, lighting style, and artistic approach throughout the entire series.\n\nCRITICAL: Reference the provided images of the same character (Patty) to ensure perfect visual consistency. This scared expression must maintain:\n- EXACTLY the same facial features and bone structure\n- EXACTLY the same fiery red hair color, texture, and ponytail style  \n- EXACTLY the same prominent freckle pattern and placement\n- EXACTLY the same 90s-style t-shirt color and design\n- EXACTLY the same skin tone and overall character design\n\nOnly change the facial expression to show scared emotion. Everything else must be identical to the reference images.",
