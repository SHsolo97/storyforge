She is sitting in shadow, wearing a long red dress dotted with shimmering gems. Long black hair tumbles over her shoulders, partially obscuring her face. Her jeweled hand is extended. The scene is illuminated only by the soft, flickering light of a single candle, creating a mysterious atmosphere. The overall style emphasizes the texture of the fabric and the glint of the gems."
